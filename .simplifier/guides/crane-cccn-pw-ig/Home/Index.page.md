## Background

Although continuous medical progress has been achieved in recent years and the treatment of many diseases has been further developed, cancer is still one of the most common causes of death in Europe. To enable effective and targeted treatment, the importance of transnational cooperation and the associated exchange of knowledge and skills is becoming increasingly significant.

As part of the EuropeÂ´s Beating Cancer Plan, the European Commission will establish an EU network linking the National Comprehensive Cancer Centres (CCCs) in every EU member state by 2025 (Flagship 5). The Joint Action CraNE is intended to support achieving this goal. The project has a duration of two years (10/2022 - 09/2024).

The initiative is coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia (NIJZ) and includes 46 partners from 25 nations spread across health care providers, university hospitals, national health authorities, research institutes and universities.

## Objectives

The overall goals of the CraNE project can be summarized as follows:

Ensure a high level of quality within cancer centers
Identify and improve organisational aspects to strengthen the link between centers to ensure patient navigation
Assessing the sustainability and feasibility of the intended networking, taking into account the different health care systems
CraNE builds on the results of the previous European Joint Actions CANCON and iPAAC.

## Patient Pathway Development

In Work Package 6 (Organization of comprehensive, high-quality cancer care in Comprehensive Cancer Care Networks (CCCN)), Task 4 has the aim of *"Enhancing patient centeredness in CCCNs with patient pathways"*. This task focuses on the development of a patient pathway for the CCCN care of lung cancer patients, which will be tested in the two pilot CCCNs in Luxembourg and Poland. The developed patient pathway includes the use by patients themselves, thus covering their perspective along the care journey in the CCCN.

<span class="hl">As a part of the development, the digitalization of patient pathways in the CCCNs will be addressed by means of creating and providing interoperability guidelines.</span>
